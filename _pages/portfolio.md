 I am currently studying for my Bachelor's in Marine engineering at Yildiz Technical University in Ä°stanbul.I have had a wide range of internships and trainings in order to broaden my experience and interests.I'm aiming to work in a field that i would call"regenerative environmental engineering ",which would focus on taking sustainability one step further by supporting regenerative practices.I'm also spending my spare time developing my personality by focusing on emotional intelligence, business management strategies and taking courses in social skills and leadership. I am passionate about advanced thermodynamics of marine diesel engines,automatic control,modeling, simulation ship engineering systems diesel engines and associated systems, ship propulsion, Gas turbines engines, Computational Fluids dynamics, Control systems, learning, motivating, writing, and maintaining integrity through honest work.
