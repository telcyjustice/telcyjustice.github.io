 I am currently studying for my Bachelor's in Marine engineering at Yildiz Technical University in İstanbul.I have had a wide range of internships and trainings in order to broaden my experience and interests.My goal is to be able to work as a Marine Engineer in a first class international vessel where I can impart my skills and knowledge in marine engineering areas such as survival techniques, handling marine equipments of up to 750KW, maneuvering engineering systems and other related machineries. These skills will help the company achieve its mission of providing a safe voyage to its passengers and crews.İn the same vein, i'm aiming to work in a field that i would call"regenerative environmental engineering ",which would focus on taking sustainability one step further by supporting regenerative practices.I'm also spending my spare time developing my personality by focusing on emotional intelligence, business management strategies and taking courses in social skills and leadership. I am passionate about learning, motivating, teaching, writing, Energy Efficiency, advanced thermodynamics of marine diesel engines, Gas turbines engines, Computational Fluids dynamics, Control systems and maintaining integrity through honest work.
